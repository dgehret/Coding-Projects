===========================================


1) The user must select two Pokémon to battle, using either
index or name (or both)

The user must select up to four moves for each Pokémon. 
Moves should be selected by index or name (or both).
If they don't select any moves, give the Pokémon 'Struggle'.

2) The higher speed Pokémon will go first. On a tie, flip a
coin. After that the Pokémon alternate turns.

3) The user will select a move for the active Pokémon.
It will do damage to the defending Pokémon.
If the defending Pokémon reaches 0 hp, the attacker wins!

The formula for damage is this:
(power * attack)/defense * STAB * type_modifier

Explanation:
Power   - the power of the move (found in the move database)
Attack  - the attack stat of the attacking pokemon
Defense - the defense stat of the defending pokemon
STAB    - see below
type_modifier - see below

========================================
4) STAB

If the type of the move matches the type of the pokemon, it will do +50% bonus
damage. It can match on either type (so a fire move by a fire/ice pokemon would get
the +50% bonus damage)

If STAB applies, the multiplier is 1.5x
If the types don't match, multiplier is 1x

========================================

5) 
If a Pokémon has the same type as the move it is 
doing it should do 50% more damage. Some attacking types deal
extra damage or less damage to defending types, as shown here:
